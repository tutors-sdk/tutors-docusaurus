2. Select `Choose`, then navigate to your `tutors-starter` folder.
3. As the folder is not linked to a remote repository, you will be prompted to `create a repository`, select the link shown here:
    ![Create](img/create.png)
4. Enter your desired repository name and select `Create Repository`.

You now have a file structure stored in a remote repository on GitHub which is used by Netlify to build and deploy the course website.
In the next step you will configure Netlify and deploy your Tutors course.
