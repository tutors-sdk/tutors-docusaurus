# Structure Documents

 Start lines with `#` to create headings. Multiple `##` in a row denote smaller heading sizes.

## This is a second-tier heading
### This is a third-tier heading
#### You get the picture..

You can use one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.

~~~
## This is a second-tier heading
### This is a thrid-tier heading
#### You get the picture..

To use `quote formatting`, enter the `>` character before the line:

> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.
> - Captain Janeway

# Code Blocks

Inline code blocks can be wrapped in backticks: `var example = true`:

~~~
`var example = true`
~~~ 

For code that spans more than one line, you can indent with four spaces:

    if (isAwesome){
      return true
    }

~~~
    if (isAwesome){
      return true
    }
~~~

Code fencing is supported, which are the code blocks used throughout this guide. To do this, use `~~~` above and below the block of code. (The following example uses `|` to be able to show the use of `~~~`, do NOT include `|` in your site):

~~~
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
~~~

~~~
|~~~
|if (isAwesome){
|  return true
|}
|~~~
