# Labs I


All things Labs


Any `book-*` folder represents a lab module. A lab module is where you will use Markdown to easily outline steps for the class to follow, in fact this tutorial is a Tutors lab. A Markdown guide is provided in this lab.

You can create more lab folders by copy / pasting an existing one, just be sure to follow the naming convention `book-*`, replacing the "\*" with a character.

Each `book-*` folder contains `img` and `archives` folders:

The `img` folder is where any images used within the lab must be stored so they can be linked to. It is important to note that each `book-*` folder has its own `img` folder and will not find images placed in any lab `img` folder other than its own.

The `archives` folder is where any archived files such as `.zip` `.rar` `.tar.gz` must be stored so they can be linked to and downloaded. Like the `img` folder, the `archives` folder is specific to the `book-*` folder it is contained in and will not find archives in another labs `archives` folder.

This lab focuses on learning to use the Markdown notation to build your course. The Markdown functionality you will be introduced to includes:

- Formatting Text


- Structuring Documents


- Code Blocks


- Images and Archives


- Links
