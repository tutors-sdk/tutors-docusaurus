# Global Video Hide

Occasionally, you may like to remove all videos from your course. This might be as the academic year rolls over perhaps, and you wish to leave the course online, but remove all videos.

~~~yaml
hideVideos     : true
~~~

This does not delete the video, or remove the video ids, that may be threaded through the content. It merely hides the videos, leaving all the assets in place.
