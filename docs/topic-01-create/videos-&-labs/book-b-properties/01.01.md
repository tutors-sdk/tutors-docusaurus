# Essential Course Files

All course should have the following files in their main folder:

- course.md
- properties.yaml
- package.json

If any of these are missing the course web will not be generated.

### course.md

This is where you define the course title and short description, for example:

~~~md
# Web Development

html · css · layout · web apps · web frameworks · deployment
~~~

### package.json

This file is required if you are using git integration to have your site built automatically on a git push on Netlify:

~~~json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "tutors-json": "^2"
  }
}
~~~

This is will change very rarely.

### properties.yaml

This is a [YAML formatted](https://circleci.com/blog/what-is-yaml-a-beginner-s-guide/) file containing course-wide parameters. It defines the following aspects:

- The Course Icon
- The contents of the 'companions' toolbar
- Course Attribution & Course Parent
- Topic show/hide settings for instructors (including PIN)
- Authentication + TutorsTime & TutorsLive
- Global video hide

In addition, two (optional) supporting files :

- calendar.yaml
- enrolment.yaml

allow additional aspects to be specified (see later in this lab).
