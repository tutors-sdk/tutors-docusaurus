# Calendar

You may choose to prominently display an academic calendar - with the current week number highlighted:

Once set up, the dialog will automatically highlight the current week. To set it up, include a file called `calendar.yaml` into your course folder. Here is an example:

~~~yaml

The title of the semester followed by a specification for each week:

- start date
- title
- type

in the format shown in the example above.

Using a calendar in conjunction with authentication adds another dimension to TutorsTime:

This shows estimates of the time online across the semester specified in the calendar file.

An instructor can use the PIN code they have set up (`ignorepin`) to reveal data for all students.
