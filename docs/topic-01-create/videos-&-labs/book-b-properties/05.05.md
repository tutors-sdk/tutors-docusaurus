# Topic show/hide settings for instructors 

When publishing a course, you may wish hide some topics, but have access to them to check formatting or layout aspects. Also, you may have an entire course already laid out, and wish to just publish a subset of the topics.

Consider the following example:

~~~yaml
ignorepin : 4019
ignore : 
  - topic-04-navigation
  - topic-05-templating
  - topic-06-semantic-code
  - topic-07-starting-play
  - topic-08-introducing-mvc
  - topic-09-models
  - topic-10-forms
  - topic-11-sessions
  - topic-12-deployment
~~~

If the above course had 12 topics (say), then topic-04 to topic-12 will be published, but hidden from students.

The instructor however, who will make up the `ignorepin`, can see all topics by entering the PIN code anywhere on the course canvas.

A useful pattern might be to set up all topics in the properties file:

~~~yaml
ignorepin : 4019
ignore : 
 # - topic-00-overview
 # - topic-01-introducing-html
 # - topic-02-introducing-css
 # - topic-03-box-model
  - topic-04-navigation
  - topic-05-templating
  - topic-06-semantic-code
  - topic-07-starting-play
  - topic-08-introducing-mvc
  - topic-09-models
  - topic-10-forms
  - topic-11-sessions
  - topic-12-deployment
~~~

In the above, we are 'commenting out' - via the `#` symbol, the first four topics - which means they will be visible to all students. Each week, then, we comment our the next topic and republish.
