# Publish a Course

To publish a course, you will need to create an account here:

- <https://www.netlify.com/>

Once you create an account and log in, you should see a page something like this:

![Netlify Home](img/nethome.png)

Underneath the `Sites` heading is a box. This is where you can upload a new version of the course. In your course template, you already have a 'compiled' version of the course in the `json` folder:

![](img/11x.png)



Drag and drop this folder into the directly on to the drop area:

 ![Drag and Drop json](img/drag.png)

The site will now be published (deployed) and you will be redirected  to the site overview page:

![Site Overview](img/newsite.png)

You can see under `Production Deploys` that the site has been published, click the link in the box at the top of the page. 

![Top Box](img/topbox.png)

This will bring you to your Tutors course website - now published and available to all via the link.

![Home](img/04x.png)

This is your personal copy of the sample course - independent of any other version, and it is now available globally via the link.

This link is not very friendly however, so we should change it. Navigate back to Netlify and select the `Domain settings` button 
![Domain Settings](img/20-domain.png)

then scroll down to the `Custom Domains` section and click the Dropdown `Options` button and select `Edit site name`.
![Edit Site Name](img/21-sitename.png)

Enter the desired domain name for your Tutors site and click `Save`.
![Choose a Name](img/12x.png)

The name must be unique globally - so the above name will not work as is, so append your initials, the date or whatever scheme make sense.

Return to the `Site Overview` page where you will notice the link to your site has changed.
