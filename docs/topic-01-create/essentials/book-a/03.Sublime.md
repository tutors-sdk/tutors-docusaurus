Navigate to the `tutors-starter` folder, then the `Select Folder` button. Note the sidebar which provides a convenient view of the file structure.

You can also just drag & drop the course folder from explorer (or Finder on Mac) directly onto an open Sublime window to open the folder as shown above.

You can select and edit most files from here. The main files of interest for the moment are:
