Download the following `.zip` file and save it to your preferred location. 

- [Tutors Template Course](archives/tutors-starter.zip)

Save this somewhere convenient - and keep note of where it is stored.

Extract the .zip file. How you do this will depend on which archiving tool you may have installed and which Operating Systems you use. On Windows for instance it might look like this:

See if you can relate the web experience to the layout of the files in the folder on your workstation. Each card is clickable, and the various tool bars along the top have tool tips, visible when you hover.
