# Font Colour

Donâ€™t use the same or similar colours for text and background. The more visible the text, the faster users are able to scan and read it. 
The W3C recommends the following contrast ratios for body text and image text:

* Small text should have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against its background.
 
*  Large text (at 14 pt bold/18 pt regular and up) should have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against its background.

Look at the below examples:
